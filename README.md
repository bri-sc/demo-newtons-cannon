## Computing in Physics Demo

This is a Bristol Scientific Computing (BriSC) Python interactive demonstration that showcases how Physics can be applied in a computing context. This provides a taster for the type of coding and approach we take on the "X with Computing" and "Scientific Computing with Data Science" programmes at the University of Bristol. See the [BriSC webpage](https://brisc.blogs.bristol.ac.uk/) and [Postgraduate Programme for Scientific Computing with Data Science](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/study/postgraduate/taught/msc-scientific-computing-with-data-science/) for more details.

As this demo is Physics-themed, this assumes some knowledge of A-level Physics but no knowledge of computing is required. This demonstrates modelling of projectile motion and the concept of Newton's Cannon.

Note: this may take a while to load as MyBinder is building a coding environment for you to use in the cloud. This will not save any changes made to the file and will timeout after a few minutes of inactivity but can be relaunched.

The Python module code used within the demo is available in the [newtons_cannon.py](https://github.com/bri-sc/demo-newtons-cannon/blob/main/newtons_cannon.py) module file and the Jupyter notebook itself is [phys.ipynb](https://github.com/bri-sc/demo-newtons-cannon/blob/main/phys.ipynb).
