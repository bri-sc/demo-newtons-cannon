This is a Bristol Scientific Computing (BriSC) Python interactive demonstration. This provides a taster for the type of coding and approach we take on the "X with Computing" and "Scientific Computing with Data Science" programmes at the University of Bristol. See the BriSC webpage and Postgraduate Programme for Scientific Computing with Data Science for more details.
